 <title>Omelet</title>
 <shortdesc>An omelet is a breakfast that is made by creating a thin layer of egg, then filling it with the filling of your choice.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Like many other breakfast foods, the omelet is entirely versatile, you put in it what you like. The outer egg shell does not even have to be egg! If you would prefer to use something else then you still can! Omelets are typically savory and often contain some type of protein alongside various veggies as the filling. </p>
